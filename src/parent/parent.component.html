    <p>Here, our parent component is implementing Default (CheckAlways) Change Detection, while the child component is
        implementing OnPush (CheckOnce) Change Detection.</p>
    <p>In the Default Change Detection, when any change happens in the parent component, all the child components in the
        tree of that parent will go through the Change Detection cycle.</p>
    <p>But, with the OnPush Change Detection, the child is only checked once for the Change Detection on initialization
        unless the component is explicitly marked as dirty.</p>

    <h3>Updating the firstName</h3>

    <p>So, when the firstName is changed, only the property of that property of that object is changed, but the object
        reference remains the same. Eventually resulting in no Change Detection at the child level</p>

    <h3>Updating the lastName</h3>

    <p>When the lastName is changed, a new reference is given to the user object and without breaking the Object
        Immutability restriction, the new reference is passed to the child component and the child component is checked
        for
        Change.</p>
    <p>Eventually resulting in the change of user details.</p>

    <h2>Explanation for the Hierarchical Dependency Injection</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Hierarchical Dependency Injection allows us to manage instantiation, lifetime, and access of services to
            different components.</li>
        <li>In angular we can specify if a given service is available application-wide (root level), module-wide (module
            level), or component level.</li>
        <li>Here in the given demo example, We have one Logger service injected at the root level which is a singleton
            service available application-wide.</li>
        <li>In the parent component, we are overriding it with the Parent Logger service which is only available in the
            parent component (which is injected at the component level instead of the root level).</li>
        <li>There is also a Child Logger service injected in the child component.</li>
    </ul>
